Hey guys, I'll add the experiments that we each need to run in our experiments and the type of results I expect us to have:

## EXPERIMENTS TO RUN ON THE DATASET:

1. Average time complexity of the algorithm (execution time and theoretical time complexity of your algorithm O(.)).
  1. I recommend you to use the time() function for getting the execution time of each problem of the dataset and find the average of all of them. 
  
2. Average accuracy with respect to the optimal weight. 
  2. I recommend you to calculate this as:
     > Total value put into the knapsack by your algorithm/optimal value of the knapsack
     > found in the /low-dimensional-optimum folder).
     
3. Relation between the execution time and the accuracy.
    > Calculate it as accuracy/time.

### Please upload a file called 'youralgo'.txt with the same name as the algorithm that you're measuring with the experimental results. 
### Please use the dataset found in http://artemisa.unicauca.edu.co/~johnyortega/instances_01_KP/
