## Project Description
This project aimed at implementing and exhaustively testing the performance of different popular approaches to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem.

Algorithms or approaches implemented and tested: 
- [Brute Force](Bruteforce.py)
- [Meet in the Middle](middle.py)
- [Backtracking](backtracking.py)
- [Branch and Bound](BaB.py)
- [Dynamic programming](dynamic.py)
- [Greedy](greedy.py)
- [Genetic](genetic.py)
- [Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme](poly.py)
- [Randomized](randomized.py)
- Multi-knapsack adaptations of the [brute force](multiBruteForce.py) and [greedy](multigreedy.py) approaches.

## Datasets Used for Testing
Data used for experimenting on these algoritms was extracted from the following sources:
- Dataset for the low-dimensional 0/1 knapsack problem: http://artemisa.unicauca.edu.co/~johnyortega/instances_01_KP/
- Dataset for the multiple knapsack problem: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/knapsack_multiple/knapsack_multiple.html
