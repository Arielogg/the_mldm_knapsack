### EXPERIMENTS FOR THE SINGLE 0/1 KP PROBLEM (Ariel):

1. Average time complexity of the algorithm
    >Execution time and theoretical time complexity of each algorithm O(.).
  
2. Average accuracy with respect to the optimal weight. I recommend you to calculate this as:
    > Total value put into the knapsack by your algorithm/optimal value of the knapsack. 
   > Found in the /low-dimensional-optimum folder).
     
3. Relation between the execution time and the accuracy.
    > Calculate it as accuracy/time.

### EXPERIMENTS FOR THE MULTIPLE KNAPSACK PROBLEM (Franck):

1. Average time complexity of the simplest algorithms (Greedy, Randomized).
2. Find accuracy of said algos for said problem.
